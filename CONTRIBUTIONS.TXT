Adam Fowles:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam worked with Nathaniel on designing the database. He worked
mostly on the look and feel of the application writing and adding
in the CSS and HTML components. Adam helped Nathaniel set up the
RLES system along with Tom. He attacked both teams
and wrote up half of the phase 4 submission along with Nathaniel.
For each submission he helped write the report. Together with
Nathaniel and Tom and he tested the system as a whole. For phase
5 he put together the poster using what the team wrote up for the
final report. 

Tom Ansill:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom has helped Adam and Nathaniel on designing the architecture of 
application. Nathaniel, Adam, and Tom did some work on RLES setup. 
Adam and Tom wrote the code for the visual side of the application 
(HTML and CSS). Tom has written some of the necessary documentation 
about the project and its usage. Tom ran a several attacks on the 
application to test the security of the application. Tom also ran a 
several attacks on other group projects as part of the project 
assignment. Adam, Nathaniel, and Tom has written the major portions 
of the project document.  

Nathaniel Cotton:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Based off the work on the database put forth by Adam, Nathaniel 
expanded upon it to add extra table to enable the overall application
to have more functionality.  Additionally, Nathaniel added stored
procedures and users to the database to added security.  However, 
due to some oversights Nathaniel indroduced a few errors in the
database that were later fixed by Adam, and him.

Due to Nathaniel's prior experience with developing web applications
he took it upon himself to lay the groundwork for the web portion of
the application. He connected the application to the database through
MyBatis, as well as setting up the Spring Framework for turning the
code into something usable by Tomcat.

Once the groundwork for the application was complete, Nathaniel 
flushed out a number of major features that would be required for 
usage of the application. However, he did very little in regards
to the visual side of the application (HTML,CSS,etc.).

Nathaniel did a fair amount of RLES setup along with Adam, and Tom.
