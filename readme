Welcome to My Night!!
Your friendly evening planner.

Before we can plan an amazing evening, we need to get 
up and running.

This application is a web application that will need 
a web server to run on.  For instance Tomcat, 8 is the
web-server that it was developed on.  Although any 
recent web-server should work.  For the sake of
deployment, we are going to focus on Tomcat 8.

For easy of packaging and project development maven
was used.  Therefore to create the assign1.war file
the following command can be run in the base
directory:

mvn clean install

For your convenience, the war file has been compiled,
and packaged.

From there the assign1.war file will be located in
the target directory.  The file will need to make
its way to the into the webapps directory on the 
Tomcat 8 web-server.  When starting up the server, the
file will be expanded into a runnable state. Now
there are many ways to add a war file to a 
Tomcat server the above is just one way.

Once the server is up and running, the application
can likely be accessed at the following address:

http://localhost:8080/assign1
